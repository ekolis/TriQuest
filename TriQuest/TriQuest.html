		<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
		 <p>TriQuest is a roguelike game in which the goal is for your party of adventurers to defeat the Chaos Lord.
		Features distinguishing it from other roguelikes include the formation system (in which multiple heroes/monsters are located in a single tile)
		the gradient-based overworld terrain map (as opposed to the dungeon maps of most other roguelikes), and a simplified inventory system.</p>
		
		<h2 id="GameMechanics">Game Mechanics</h2>
		<h3>Subtiles and Formations</h3>
			<p>Each tile on the map in TriQuest is divided into nine "subtiles", arranged in a 3x3 grid.
			Heroes and monsters are arranged into formations, with each creature occupying a single subtile.
			No more than one creature may occupy a single subtile.
			Formations also have a facing; when the formation rotates, the creatures shift within the tile to new subtiles to match the formation's new facing.</p>
		<h3>Overworld Map</h3>
			<p>When the map is generated, a number of "hotspots" are placed. Hotspots are locations where dangerous monsters will be found.
			The most dangerous hotspot will contain the Chaos Lord, so be careful!
			Surrounding the hotspots will be "danger zones", with the danger level decreasing the further you get from the hotspot.
			You can get clued in on whether the danger is increasing or decreasing as you travel by keeping an eye on the monsters and terrain, as both vary with the danger level.</p>
		<h3>Items</h3>
			<p>There are three types of items: weapons, armor, and consumables.</p>
			<p>Weapons and armor are fairly similar; each hero can equip one of each, and each is specific to a particular hero.
			Weapons and armor modify the heroes' stats, with weapons tending to increase attack and armor tending to increase defense.
			The party need not carry duplicate items, so the inventory system is simplified from most other roguelikes:
			finding a particular weapon or armor for the first time simply sets a flag that it's been found, and from then on, you can choose to equip it.</p>
			<p>Consumables consist of health and mana potions, each of which comes in two flavors:
			a "pack of small potions" (restores some HP or MP to all heroes), and a "large potion" (restores a lot of HP or MP to the hero with the least remaining).
			Potions are used immediately upon being found, so if you want to save a potion for later because your HP or MP are full, you'll have to avoid stepping over it.</p>
			<p>Items are designed so that no particular item is intrinsically better than another; each has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
		<h3>Combat</h3>
			<p>When two formations engage in combat (e.g. the heroes and a group of monsters), each creature in the attacking formation first chooses a target.
			This is done automatically; the creature chooses the target that is nearest to him.
			Next, the attacker chooses an attack type: physical or mental.
			If the difference between the Mind stats of attacker and target is greater then the difference between their Body stats, the attacker will choose a mental attack;
			otherwise he will choose a physical attack.</p>
			<p>To resolve the attack, the attacker rolls AdX, where A is the attacker's Attack stat, and X is the attacker's Body or Mind stat, depending on the type of attack.
			The defender rolls DdX, where D is the defender's Defense stat, and X is the defender's Body or Mind stat, depending on the type of attack.
			The damage inflicted then is equal to the difference between the two rolls, or zero if the attack roll is less than the defense roll.</p>
			<p>However, if the distance between the attacker and the defender is greater than the range of the attacker, then the attacker must roll 1d3 for each extra subtile of distance.
			If any of the rolls come up 1, then the attack misses and does no damage.</p>
